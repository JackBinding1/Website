This home page is to mirror the home file
purpose being the URL now says "Home" rather than "Index"..
I suspect a better way of doing this but this will do for now

                <!--
                <p>
                    After a pretty unsuccessful departure from school, with 1 GCSE under my belt and finding myself working in a warehouse between the ages of 17 and 24.
                    <br> Spending all of my free time playing video games, things were not looking too good... I then fell into running at some point during my early 20's due to some friends trying interval training.<br>
                    The following year, I ran my first half marathon and returned to college to re-do my GCSEs.
                    <br> This eventually led me to study a degree in Mathematics and to try my hand a range of sports. 
                    <br> Here I will document things I find interesting from my day job as a Senior Analytics Engineer at a marketing and risk consultancy agency and sport related things I am up to.
                    <br> This may also include various odd things and some talks of Wainwrights.
                </p>
