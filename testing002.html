Still not entirely sure how best to format or lay this out. But we'll see how we get on.

         <h2>Brief overview of what is happening here...</h2>
             
     <p>After half a year of inactivity due to a failing Thyroid gland, by Febuary 2024 I was feeling quite settled on the levo... <br>
    This is my running progress after Febuary 2024 trying to get back into some kind of reasonable shape.. The plan here is to share my thoughts and feelings about getting back into running from barely being able to walk more than 30 minutes without being tired. </p>

 <h3><br><br>First 5k of 2024</h3>
 <p><br>After progressively trying to walk a bit more each day and running at least twice a week for a month or so, went out for a run just a day after my previous run feeling quite good. No expectations for this run, just wanted to get out for 20 minutes or so and get a bit of a sweat on before showering and heading out... Realised 25 minutes in that I could probably make it to the 5k mark. A few moments of walking to catch my breath or give my legs a rest from the hills. I got it done.. Very pleased. </p>
